## Wording

### SRD vs Custom

The SRD is the document that contains all the rules of the game. It contains a lot of default elements like (weapons, spells, classes, etc...). The custom elements are the ones that are not in the SRD but created by a user.

### Private vs Public

A private element is an element that is only visible to the creator and the people that the creator shared it with. A public element is an element that is visible to everyone.

In this case, a public element has a public version of it's content and a private version. The private version is the one that the creator can edit and the public version is the one that everyone can see.
